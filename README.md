### Potential Issues
You may run into issues with the Boxy theme and a few other packages on install as they appear to try to apply settings before installing their dependecies (theme files etc, you know, important things)

A simple fix is to let Sublime finish downloading updates, close it, then discard changes in the repo via git. That or just let it default back to the default Monkai theme.
